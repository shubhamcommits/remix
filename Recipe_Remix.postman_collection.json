		"description": "Greetings and welcome to the Remix Recipe API Documentation. Our aim is to provide you with a comprehensive guide to ensure a seamless developer experience.\n\nThe Remix Recipe API is composed of six primary collections, each catering to different use cases, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Auths Collection: This collection handles the authentication aspect utilizing Auth0 as its backend. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Login: This endpoint logs in a user and grants access to the system with the appropriate headers.  \n    b. Logout: This endpoint logs out the currently logged-in user.\n2. Recipes Collection: This collection is responsible for handling all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to recipes. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Fetch Recipe: This endpoint fetches the details of a recipe by its ID.  \n    b. Create Recipe: This endpoint parses, fetches, extracts and saves a recipe into the system.  \n    c. Remove Recipe: This endpoint removes a recipe by its ID.  \n    d. Update Recipe: This endpoint updates the details of a recipe by its ID.  \n    e. Fetch All Recipes: This endpoint fetches all the recipes that are present in the system.\n3. Remix Collection: This collection is responsible for handling all CRUD operations related to remixes. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Fetch Remix: This endpoint fetches the details of a remix by its ID.  \n    b. Create Remix: This endpoint saves a remix of a recipe into the system.  \n    c. Remove Remix: This endpoint removes a remix by its ID.  \n    d. Update Remix: This endpoint updates the details of a remix by its ID.  \n    e. Fetch All Remixes: This endpoint fetches all the remixes that are present in the system.\n4. Remix Types Collection: This collection is responsible for handling all CRUD operations related to remix types. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Fetch All Remix Types: This endpoint fetches all the remix types that are present in the system.  \n    b. Fetch Remix Type: This endpoint fetches the details of a remix type by its ID.  \n    c. Create Remix Type: This endpoint saves a new remix type into the system.  \n    d. Remove Remix Type: This endpoint removes a remix type by its ID.  \n    e. Update Remix Type: This endpoint updates the details of a remix type by its ID.\n5. Users Collection: This collection is responsible for handling all CRUD operations related to users. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Create User: This endpoint saves a new user into the system.  \n    b. Fetch All Users: This endpoint fetches all the users that are present in the system.\n6. Miscellaneous Collection: This collection is responsible for housing helper APIs to test various business functionalities. It includes the following endpoints:  \n    a. Health Check: A generic health check endpoint to check if the system is healthy and running efficiently.  \n    b. Parse Recipe: This endpoint parses/scrapes the recipe details from a URL.  \n    c. Extract Recipe: This endpoint fetches the list of ingredients, instructions, and a title from a raw text generated by OpenAI for a recipe.  \n    d. AI Generate Remix: This endpoint generates the remix of a recipe using OpenAI.\n    \n\nWe hope that this documentation proves to be a valuable resource as you work with the Remix Recipe API.
